# 1. Business Context  

New York City is replacing the aging Rikers Island complex with **four Borough-Based Jails**—a multi-billion-dollar, multi-year program involving dozens of contractors, intensive public scrutiny, and one of the most complex regulatory environments in U.S. construction.  
Key pressures:

* 1,000+ design packages spanning BIM, Civil 3D, and 2D PDFs  
* Thousands of RFIs, submittals, and schedule updates generated monthly  
* Layer-cake of regulations: NYC Zoning Resolution, CEQR, Chapter 33 Safety, Accessibility, M/WBE goals, and Design-Build contract KPIs  
* Zero tolerance for compliance lapses given political visibility and mandated timelines

Traditional manual processes cannot scale; stakeholders need **real-time visibility, automated compliance checks, and audit-ready reporting**.

# 2. Demo Objectives  

| # | Objective | Proof Point in Demo |
|---|-----------|--------------------|
| 1 | Showcase automated **ingestion & classification** of BIM drawings, RFIs, and schedules | AI categorises uploaded docs in seconds and assigns metadata |
| 2 | Demonstrate **regulatory compliance verification** (Zoning, CEQR, Chapter 33) | Trust-oriented agent flags missing fall-protection plan; links regulation §1926.501 |
| 3 | Generate **Project Management & Inspection reports** in minutes | One-click creation of an audit-ready report with evidence links |
| 4 | Illustrate **AI-driven schedule optimisation** | Integration agent adjusts critical path when structural steel delivery slips |
| 5 | Provide **traceability & audit trail** | Every AI decision logged with source docs, timestamps, confidence scores |

# 3. Target Audience  

* **Owner’s Representative / Program Execs** – need high-level risk & compliance snapshots  
* **Design-Build GC Project Managers** – require rapid RFI turnaround & schedule accuracy  
* **City Agency Reviewers (DOC, DDC, DOB)** – demand audit-ready compliance evidence  
* **BIM/VDC Coordinators** – want seamless linkage between models, drawings, and field data  
* **IT & Innovation Leaders** – evaluate platform fit for enterprise roll-out  

# 4. Key Value Propositions Demonstrated  

| Challenge | PlexifyAEC AI Capability | Demo Highlight |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Document deluge & version chaos | NLP-powered **Document Intake Agent** auto-classifies, versions, and links related files | Upload 50 mixed files → organised library in <30 s |
| Regulatory maze | **Compliance Matrix Engine** maps docs to NYC regulations, auto-identifies gaps | Missing CEQR dust-mitigation plan flagged with corrective action |
| Slow RFI cycles | **RFI Triage Agent** extracts questions, suggests answers from spec corpus | Draft RFI response generated, manager approves with one click |
| Schedule slippage | **Schedule Optimiser Agent** predicts impact, offers mitigation scenarios | Gantt view shows 2-week recovery plan |
| Audit fatigue | **Report Generator Agent** compiles evidence, decisions, and sign-offs | Generates Chapter 33 Inspection Report PDF with embedded citations |

# 5. Demo Scope  

1. **Sandbox Dataset**  
   * 3 BIM models (Architectural, Structural, MEP)  
   * 25 RFIs (design clarifications & field issues)  
   * Baseline + updated P6 schedule (steel delay scenario)  
2. **Workflows Shown**  
   * Design Change Review (BIM markup → compliance check → updated schedule)  
   * RFI Lifecycle (submission → AI answer suggestion → approval → closeout)  
   * Weekly PM Report (cost, schedule variance, risk)  
   * Safety Inspection Report (Chapter 33 focus)  
3. **Integrations Used** – Autodesk ACC (BIM), Bluebeam (PDF markups), Primavera P6 (schedule) – all in sandbox mode.

# 6. Success Criteria  

* < 5 minutes from document upload to compliant classification  
* ≥ 90 % accuracy in regulation-to-document mapping (validated live)  
* PM report produced in under 60 seconds, downloadable as PDF/JSON  
* Audience affirms “clear time/cost saving” in live Q&A poll  

# 7. Call to Action  

At demo close we will invite participants to:

1. **Pilot PlexifyAEC** on one active Borough-Based Jail package  
2. Provide feedback to refine compliance matrices for NYC agencies  
3. Explore enterprise licence aligning with project milestone schedule  

*PlexifyAEC transforms regulatory complexity into predictable, auditable workflows—freeing teams to build the next generation of civic infrastructure on time and on budget.*
